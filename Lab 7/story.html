    <h1>How Voldemort ruined my chances of going to Hogwarts</h1>
    <main>
      <p>
        The Return of Lord Voldemort took place on the 24 June, 1995. I was born
        in 1996 to Muggle parents. As we all you-know-who hates muggle-born,
        <em>the hypocrite</em>. His father was a Muggle which makes him part
        muggle.
      </p>
      <p>
        This hate led him to erase the names of all the muggle born witches and
        wizards from the registry, <strong>including mine</strong>. And so, here
        I am writing my story with my own hands when this could have been easily
        done with the swish of a wand.
      </p>
      <p>
          But it is what it is.
